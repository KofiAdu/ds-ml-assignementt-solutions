# Assignment Solutions – Machine Learning & Data Science

This repository contains my solutions to various assignments completed during my learning journey in Machine Learning and Data Science. Each notebook represents a structured attempt to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems.

## Contents

The assignments cover a range of core ML/DS topics, including:

- Supervised Learning  
  Linear & Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests

- Unsupervised Learning  
  K-Means Clustering, PCA

- Model Evaluation  
  Confusion matrices, ROC curves, cross-validation, and performance metrics

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
  Text preprocessing, vectorization, basic sentiment analysis

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- Recommender Systems  
  Similarity-based and collaborative filtering approaches

## Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn, NLTK 

## Purpose

These solutions are primarily educational and reflect my approach to solving ML/DS problems using Python. Each notebook includes:
- Clear problem statements  
- Step-by-step implementation  
- Comments and explanations  
- Visualizations and insights
